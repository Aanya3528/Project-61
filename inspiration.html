	<h3>I was in art class. We had to draw a bird. I saw my friend making the cutest eyes on the bird. I asked her if she could draw it for me. She agreed and did the same. When the holidays came , I started drawing. I came across a channel named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3dEvA1is6-0_yuei9iCdEw" target = "_blank">Draw So Cute</a>. It was awesome. The girl who made this channel is called wenny. She is the best at drwing. So i watched a video from the channel almost every day. I still do but not as much. </h3>
